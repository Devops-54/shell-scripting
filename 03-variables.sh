# What is a variable ? Variable is used to store and pass values
# a = 10
# name=Verma
# batch=54
# topic=shellscripting

# In bash there is no concept of Data Types : By default everything is a string
# int a = 10 
# string b = Manu 
# float c = 0.15

# This is how we can declare variables in Bash 
a=10 
b=20
c=30

# Syntax : $variableName : $ is going to print the value of the variable
echo $a
echo value of the variable is $a
